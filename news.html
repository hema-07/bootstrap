<p>Hair and Makeup by Steph on Instagram: “I had a dream last night that I was driving out of a snowy parking lot and I almost hit @richardmannah. Isn't it weird how you can have a dream about someone you've talked to literally twice in your whole life? sorry for almost killing you Richard. #hairandmakeupbysteph </p>

<p>Say goodbye to the half-up/half-down bun – double buns have officially taken over as the trendiest cool girl hairstyle of the season. It’s only fitting, considering how many other late 90’s/early 2000’s trends are considered stylish again. Double buns are also known as space buns, and they always make me think of my childhood obsession with the Spice Girls. They’re cute, fun, unique, and easy to do – and they’re also super versatile. As it turns out, there isn’t only one way to do space</p>
